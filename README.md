# Dviscord - CÃ©line DEMONSANT & Alex DRU

Here is a short manual to use the Dviscord

## Getting Started

The Dviscord is a VoIP coded in Python language. It features two programs: Server & Client and it allows different clients to have a voice chat through a server.

### Prerequisites

Make sure to change the IP address in the beginning of every program. The IP address must be the one of the Computer that is running the Server.

You will first need to install the pyaudio library.
To install it, run the commands:

```
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev

pip3 install pyaudio
```

## Running the Dviscord

First run the Server program, then the different clients. There is only one Server on which you can connect as many clients as you want.
